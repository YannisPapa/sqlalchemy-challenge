# sqlalchemy-challenge

This is my submission for Module 10 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

The app.py and ipynb files can be found above in the folder SurfsUp in this repo.

There is 1 sub folder for Resources containing some csv files and the sqlite file. Running climate_starter.ipynb will give youa  notebook analyzing the data from the csv's using a database. Running app.py will start up a web based api that you can use to get data from the cvs's through a database.
